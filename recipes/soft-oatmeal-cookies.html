    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is healthier than double chocolate chip cookies! Soft, and moist, so you can always eat more (in moderation, but I'm not a doctor)!</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, cream together butter, white sugar, and brown sugar. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla. Combine flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon; stir into the creamed mixture. Mix in oats. Cover, and chill dough for at least one hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls, and place 2 inches apart on cookie sheets. Flatten each cookie with a large fork dipped in sugar.</li>
